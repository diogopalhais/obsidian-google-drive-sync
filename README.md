# Obsidian Google Drive Sync Plugin

This plugin allows you to sync your Obsidian vault with Google Drive with automatic two-way synchronization, conflict resolution, and support for all file types.

## Features

- **Two-way sync**: Automatically sync changes in both directions
- **Incremental sync**: Only sync files that have been modified since last sync for better performance and reduced API usage
- **Automatic sync**: Sync on file changes and at configurable intervals
- **Conflict resolution**: Choose how to handle conflicts when files are modified in both places
- **All file types**: Sync not just markdown files, but all files in your vault including images, PDFs, and binary files
- **Status indicator**: See sync status in the status bar
- **Manual controls**: Manual sync commands for one-way or bidirectional sync
